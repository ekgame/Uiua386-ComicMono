# Uiua386 + ComicMono

Comic sans font for Uiua code.

The code in this project downloads the latest Uiua386 font from the Uiua repository and replaces most of the ASCII characters with the ones from ComicMono font, resulting in a blend of the two fonts for a fun twist. While it may not seem like a serious font, Comic Sans is known to be extra legible and often used by dislexic people. It is also fun though.

## Usage

If you just need the font, head to the releases page for the repository and download it from there.

If you would like to generate the font yourself, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and FontForge installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `python3 patch.py`.
4. A file named "Uiua386+ComicMono.ttf" should be generated.
